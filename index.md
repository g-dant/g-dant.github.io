# Hello World!

I am Dant.G, a strong enthusiast of __Computer Science__, __Data Science__, __Applied Mathematics__, __Statistics__ and __Data Engineering__. 

## About Me

I am an engineer graduated at Central School of Lyon (France - Generalist Engineering) and at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ, Brazil - Computer and Electronic Engineering). I am also an Applied Mathematician at the same university. 

## Purpose

This site is currently under development so I can record / share my Github projects and my personal study notes! I love to invent things and sharing them is even better.
